"""Compacts the history into a summary when the context grows, and adds /compact.

Compacting asks the model for a summary of the conversation and continues in
a new session holding that summary and the last exchange. The old session
stays on disk untouched: ``/resume <id>`` brings the full history back.

It runs by itself at the end of a turn whose context reached ``compact_at``
tokens (providers that report no usage never trigger it), and on demand with
``/compact``. Set the threshold in settings.json::

    {"extensions": {"settings": {"compact": {"compact_at": 150000}}}}

Install it with ``/ext``.
