"""Subagent tool: delegates a task to a fresh agent loop with its own history.

The subagent uses the current provider, model and tools (except this one, so
subagents do not start subagents; tools reloaded with reload_extensions take
effect on its next request) and starts from an empty history. Only its
last message returns to the caller, which keeps long searches and
investigations out of the main conversation. The user sees the subagent's
tool calls, is asked for the same confirmations, and can interrupt it.

Install it with ``/ext``.
